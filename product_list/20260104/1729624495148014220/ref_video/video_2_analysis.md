### 7. Replication Checklist (DE) | 德国市场复刻清单
*   **Do Copy (要复制):**
    *   ✅ **German Text Overlays:** Use simple, colloquial German (e.g., "Lieblingsspielzeug", "Hier bestellen").
    *   ✅ **Named Protagonist:** Introduce the pet by name ("Charlie", "Luna", "Simba") to create an emotional bond.
    *   ✅ **Floor-Level Angle:** Shoot from the cat's eye level or slightly above to capture the pouncing action clearly.
    *   ✅ **Multi-Cat Chaos:** If possible, show more than one cat to double the "cute" factor and prove broad appeal.
*   **Do Avoid (要避免):**
    *   ❌ **Over-editing:** Don't use too many jump cuts that hide the actual movement of the toy. The "hunt" needs continuity.
    *   ❌ **Loud/Jarring Music:** Use playful but not aggressive audio. The focus is on the cats.
    *   ❌ **Complex Explanations:** Don't explain *how* the motor works. Just show the *result* (the fun).
