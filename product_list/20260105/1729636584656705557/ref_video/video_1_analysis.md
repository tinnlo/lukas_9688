## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY) | 建议 (做/不做/机会)

**DO:**
1.  **DO focus on relatable pain points:** Continue to start videos by highlighting common frustrations that the product effectively solves, as this proved to be a strong hook. | **务必**关注相关的痛点：继续以突出产品有效解决的常见痛点来开始视频，因为这被证明是一个强有力的开场。
2.  **DO utilize clear feature demonstrations:** Showcase the product's benefits through direct, concise visual demonstrations, emphasizing ease of use, precision, and efficiency. | **务必**利用清晰的功能演示：通过直接、简洁的视觉演示来展示产品优势，强调易用性、精准性和效率。
3.  **DO offer compelling incentives:** The 50% discount and free cleaning set were powerful motivators. Continue to experiment with strong, time-sensitive offers to drive conversions. | **务必**提供有吸引力的激励：50%的折扣和免费清洁套装是强大的推动力。继续尝试强大、有时效性的优惠以推动转化。

**DON'T:**
1.  **DON'T neglect the "why":** While the video shows "what" the product does, ensure the "why" (e.g., why Makita compatibility matters, why precise control is superior) is always implicitly or explicitly clear. | **不要**忽视“为什么”：虽然视频展示了产品“做什么”，但要确保“为什么”（例如，为什么牧田兼容性很重要，为什么精确控制更优越）始终是隐式或显式清晰的。
2.  **DON'T assume audience knowledge:** Avoid jargon where possible or explain technical terms briefly. The video was good at this, but it's a general pitfall to avoid. | **不要**假设受众知识：尽可能避免使用行话或简要解释技术术语。视频在这方面做得很好，但这是一个普遍需要避免的陷阱。
3.  **DON'T underutilize on-screen text for reinforcement:** Beyond the offer, consider using brief text overlays to highlight key features or benefits as they are demonstrated to reinforce understanding, especially for viewers watching without sound. | **不要**低估屏幕文字的强化作用：除了优惠信息，可以考虑使用简短的文字叠加来突出关键功能或优点，以便在演示时强化理解，特别是对于无声观看的观众。

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1.  **OPPORTUNITY to leverage user-generated content (UGC) testimonials:** Incorporate short, authentic testimonials from German users demonstrating their satisfaction and specific use cases to build further trust and social proof. | **机会**利用用户生成内容（UGC）证言：加入德国用户的简短、真实的证言，展示他们的满意度和具体使用场景，以建立进一步的信任和社会证明。
2.  **OPPORTUNITY for comparison shots:** Briefly show a side-by-side comparison with a traditional manual caulk gun to more dramatically illustrate the speed, ease, and quality difference. | **机会**进行对比拍摄：简要展示与传统手动胶枪的并排对比，以更具戏剧性地说明速度、便利性和质量差异。
3.  **OPPORTUNITY to address potential objections:** Briefly address common concerns (e.g., "Is it heavy?", "Is it easy to clean?") through quick visual cues or verbal answers in future videos to preemptively overcome barriers to purchase. | **机会**解决潜在异议：通过快速的视觉提示或未来视频中的口头回答，简要解决常见问题（例如，“它重吗？”，“它容易清洁吗？”），以预先克服购买障碍。
