# Fence Brush Painting Problem - Visual Prompts

Reference for creating "before" comparison visuals showing the frustration and poor quality of traditional brush painting on fences.

## Image Prompt (Problem Hook)

**Use case**: Opening hook image (3s) or comparison slide

```
Extreme close-up photo of a weathered wooden fence being painted with a traditional paintbrush, showing ugly vertical brush streaks, uneven coverage with some areas too thick (dripping) and others too thin (wood showing through), bristle marks clearly visible in the wet paint, paint pooling in corners, and a hand holding a dripping brush with paint running down the handle. Natural outdoor lighting reveals every imperfection. The image conveys frustration and poor quality - this is what people want to avoid. Realistic texture, professional photography, shallow depth of field focusing on the streaky paint surface.

## Video Prompt (8s - Veo 3.1)

**Duration**: 8 seconds  
**Use case**: Opening hook video showing brush painting pain points

```
8-second cinematic video starting with close-up of a hand dipping a traditional paintbrush into gray fence paint, pulling it out with paint dripping heavily from bristles. Camera follows as the brush makes contact with weathered wooden fence slats - slow motion shows paint applying unevenly, creating visible vertical streaks and bristle marks. Paint drips run down the wood. Hand struggles to maintain even pressure, missing spots between slats. Camera pulls back slightly to reveal more ugly streaks and patches across multiple fence boards. Frustrated body language - shoulder drops, slight head shake. Natural outdoor lighting, realistic texture, the mood is tedious and unsatisfying. Final frame holds on the messy streaky surface.
```

**Camera movement**: Start close, slight pull-back  
**Pace**: Slow motion for brush contact (0-4s), normal speed for pull-back (4-8s)  
**Mood**: Frustration, tedium, imperfection
