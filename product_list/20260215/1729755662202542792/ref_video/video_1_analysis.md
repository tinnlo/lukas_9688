## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY) | 建议 (做/不做/机会)

**DO:**
1.  **Add Text Overlays (添加文字):** Use German text like "Hält 34h kalt!" (Keeps cold 34h) or "Der perfekte Begleiter" (The perfect companion) to emphasize features.
2.  **Show Ice Test (展示冰块测试):** Visually prove the insulation by showing ice still solid after hours. This is a standard conversion driver for tumblers.
3.  **ASMR Elements (ASMR元素):** Add sound of ice clinking or straw sipping to increase sensory engagement.

**DON'T:**
1.  **Rely solely on the logo (不要仅依赖Logo):** While the brand pulls views, feature demos (leak proof, car fit) drive *conversions*.
2.  **Ignore the car context (不要忽视车内场景):** The 40oz tapered base is designed for cars. Not showing it in a car cup holder is a missed opportunity.
3.  **Leave it silent (不要静音):** Even without VO, use trending audio or sound effects to boost algorithmic reach.

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1.  **Office Envy Angle (办公室让人羡慕的角度):** "POV: You bring this to the office" - tapping into social status.
2.  **Energy Drink Pour (倒入能量饮料):** Show pouring actual Red Bull into the cup with ice. Visual synergy.
3.  **Bundle Deal (套餐优惠):** Suggest buying 2 (one for you, one for a friend) to increase AOV (Average Order Value).
