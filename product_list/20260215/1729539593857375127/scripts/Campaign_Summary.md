## 2. Campaign Strategy | 活动策略

**Core Insight (核心洞察):** Analysis from `video_synthesis.md` reveals that the "Magical Reveal" hook pattern works best – showing instant transformation from dark/boring room to aesthetic paradise within 0.5 seconds creates a dopamine-triggering pattern interrupt.

**Three-Pronged Approach (三管齐下策略):**

1. **Script 1 - Vibe Shift (氛围转变):** Targets aesthetic-conscious younger audience (Gen Z/Millennial) with dramatic visual transformation and content creation angle
2. **Script 2 - Remote Control Power (遥控功能展示):** Feature-led demo for tech-savvy buyers who want control and versatility
3. **Script 3 - Cozy Atmosphere (舒适氛围):** Emotional wellness angle addressing German *Winterdepression* (winter blues) and self-care needs

**Compliance Note (合规说明):** All scripts avoid exact € pricing, absolute claims ("100%", "perfekt"), and exaggerated promotions per TikTok DE policy requirements.

## 3. Key Selling Points | 核心卖点

From `image_analysis.md` Section 4 and `video_synthesis.md` Section 5:

1. **Instant Atmosphere Creator (即时氛围营造):** Transforms room in <1 second – perfect for the German preference for quick, functional solutions
2. **16 Color Versatility (16色多功能):** Not just sunset orange; includes pink (party), cyan (focus/gaming), green (nature vibes) for different moods
3. **Remote Control Convenience (遥控便利性):** Control from bed/couch without getting up – appeals to comfort-seeking behavior
4. **Content Creation Tool (内容创作工具):** Creates professional-looking shadows and silhouettes for TikTok/Instagram content
5. **USB Flexibility (USB灵活性):** Works with laptop, powerbank, or phone charger – addresses German concern about compatibility

**Trust Builders (信任建立点):** `image_analysis.md` Section 7 notes EC REP/UK REP compliance marks visible on packaging, and the easy 4-step assembly diagram ("Extremely Easy Installation").

## 4. Target Audience | 目标受众

**Primary Segment (主要群体):** German Gen Z/Millennials (18-35) living in rented apartments who:
- Value aesthetic home environments but have limited renovation options
- Experience winter mood challenges (short daylight hours)
- Create social media content (TikTok, Instagram)
- Seek affordable room upgrades (budget-conscious)

**Secondary Segment (次要群体):** Gift buyers looking for unique presents for partners, friends, or students moving into dorms

**Psychographic Insight (心理特征洞察):** Per `video_synthesis.md` Section 6, Germans want to know *how* things work. Showing the physical lamp hardware, USB plug, and remote control builds trust that it's a real product, not just editing tricks.

## 6. Production Notes | 制作说明

### Critical DO's (必做事项):
- Film in pitch-black darkness first to maximize light contrast (参考 `video_synthesis.md` Section 4)
- Use clean white wall for projections to show true color quality
- Include hand-in-frame moments to prove real light (not filter) – addresses German skepticism
- Show remote control close-up to prove functionality

### Critical DON'Ts (禁忌事项):
- **Avoid package close-ups** – `image_analysis.md` Section 8 warns of typos on box ("GALSS", "ENGERGY") that look cheap
- **Do NOT mention exact price** – Compliance policy forbids "€9.99" or "50% Rabatt"
- **Skip battery discussion** – Remote needs 2x AAA (not included) which causes complaints; not a selling point

### Visual Must-Haves (视觉必备镜头):
1. The "switch-on moment" (dark → light transformation)
2. Shadow play with plants or hands
3. Color cycling sequence (minimum 4 colors shown)
4. Physical lamp hardware (proves it's real product)
5. USB plug-in shot (shows ease of use)
