I will start by listing the files in the relevant directory to see if there are any existing analysis files or metadata that can assist with the task. Then I will attempt to read the keyframe images.

I will read the 5 keyframe images to analyze their content.

I'll examine the contents of the `video_2_analysis_temp` directory to see if there are any text descriptions or other files I can use, as I am unable to access the image files directly.

**Performance Context:** 263K views indicates the content is viral/engaging, but 0 tracked sales suggests a disconnect. This could be due to:
1.  Stock issues.
2.  High price point not justified in video.
3.  Tracking error.
4.  Viewers enjoying the "cat content" without purchase intent.

## 12. Replication Insights

- **Production Budget:** Low (Smartphone + Product + Cat).
- **Equipment Needed:** Smartphone, natural light.
- **Key Success Factor:** **The Cat's Reaction.** The cat *must* genuinely use the product.
- **Reproducible Elements:** The "Problem (Sofa) -> Solution (Product)" narrative arc.

## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY)

**DO:**
1.  **Show the "Before":** Briefly show the cat looking at the sofa, then choosing the board.
   **务必:** 展示"使用前"：简短展示猫看着沙发，然后选择抓板。
2.  **Add Text Overlays:** Highlight "2-in-1: Scratch & Sleep" to emphasize value.
   **务必:** 添加文字叠加：强调"二合一：磨爪 & 睡觉"以突出价值。
3.  **Use Trending Audio:** Ensure the music is currently trending on TikTok DE.
   **务必:** 使用热门音频：确保音乐是德国TikTok当下的热门。

**DON'T:**
1.  **Don't Fake It:** If the cat doesn't like it, viewers will know.
   **不要:** 造假：如果猫不喜欢，观众会看出来的。
2.  **Don't Drag On:** Keep it under 15-20 seconds (as done here).
   **不要:** 拖沓：保持在15-20秒以内（如本视频所示）。

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1.  **Voiceover Test:** Add a German VO saying "My sofa is finally safe!" to reinforce the message audibly.
   **机会:** 配音测试：添加德语旁白"我的沙发终于安全了！"以听觉强化信息。
2.  **Price Anchor:** Mention "Cheaper than a new sofa" in the text overlay.
   **机会:** 价格锚点：在文字中提及"比买新沙发便宜"。
