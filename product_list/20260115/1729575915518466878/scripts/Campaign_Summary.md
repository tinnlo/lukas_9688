## 2. Campaign Strategy | 活动策略

| Script | Angle | Hook Type | Duration | Target Conversion |
|:-------|:------|:----------|:---------|:------------------|
| **AutoPet_Dispenser_Clean_Water** | Problem-Solution | Dirty Water Pain Point | 30s | 2-4% (Primary) |
| **AutoPet_Dispenser_ASMR_Flow** | Sensory/ASMR | Water Flow Sound + Visual | 25s | 1-3% (Engagement) |
| **AutoPet_Dispenser_Weekend_Freedom** | Lifestyle/Freedom | Weekend Travel Guilt | 32s | 2-4% (Emotional) |

**Strategy Rationale:** Previous videos failed due to weak hooks (schwache Hooks | 弱钩子) and missing CTAs. New scripts implement proven patterns: relatable pain points (nachvollziehbare Schmerzpunkte | 可共鸣痛点), sensory engagement, and lifestyle benefits with explicit CTAs.

## 5. Scripts Summary | 脚本摘要

### Script 1: Clean Water (Problem-Solution)
**File:** `AutoPet_Dispenser_Clean_Water.md`

Targets "dirty water" pain point with before/after contrast. Strong visual: empty/dirty bowl → automatic fresh water supply. Emphasizes battery-free operation and 8-hour workday scenario. **Best for:** Direct conversion, practical buyers.

### Script 2: ASMR Flow (Sensory Engagement)
**File:** `AutoPet_Dispenser_ASMR_Flow.md`

Leverages water flow sounds and slow-motion visuals for ASMR appeal. Softer sell focusing on "calming presence" for both pet and owner. **Best for:** High engagement, shareability, algorithm favor.

### Script 3: Weekend Freedom (Lifestyle/Emotional)
**File:** `AutoPet_Dispenser_Weekend_Freedom.md`

Addresses "weekend trip guilt" with freedom narrative. Shows 48-hour functionality and split-screen owner relaxing while pet stays hydrated. **Best for:** Emotional connection, lifestyle aspirants.

## 6. Production Notes | 制作说明

*From image_analysis.md Section 10:*

**Essential Shots:**
- Clean, bright lighting to showcase white aesthetic
- Pet drinking action (builds trust)
- Close-up: Water flowing from reservoir to bowl (ASMR + mechanism proof)
- Human hands: Filling, opening reservoir, cleaning components
- Text overlays for key features (battery-free, capacity, 2-in-1)

**Avoid:**
- Dim/dark environments that obscure product
- Fast edits preventing feature comprehension
- Generic "cute pet" footage without product context

## 7. Success Metrics & Next Steps | 成功指标与后续步骤

**Target Metrics:**
- Conversion Rate: 2-5% (up from current 0.00%)
- CTR: 3-6% to product page
- Engagement: 5-10% (likes, saves, shares)

**Testing Sequence:**
1. Launch Script 1 (Problem-Solution) first - highest conversion potential
2. Monitor 48-hour performance
3. Deploy Script 2 (ASMR) if Script 1 shows ≥1.5% conversion
4. Deploy Script 3 (Lifestyle) to capture emotional segment

**Optimization:**
- A/B test with/without pricing in caption
- Test pet type: Cat-only vs. Dog-only vs. Both
- Refine German voiceover tone based on engagement comments
