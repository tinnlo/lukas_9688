## Consolidated Strategy Analysis

### Key Selling Points Emphasized

1. **"Entwässern" (De-bloating):** The primary value proposition. Solves the immediate visual problem of puffiness
2. **Natural Ingredients:** 7-fold complex, Nettle (Brennnessel), Horse Chestnut. Appeals to the "clean label" trend
3. **Beauty Benefits:** "Glow Up" and connective tissue support. Moving beyond just health to vanity metrics

### Visual Elements & Editing Style

- **Fast-Paced Cuts:** To maintain retention (avg. duration < 25s for most viral clips)
- **Text Overlays:** Critical for sound-off viewing (e.g., "7kg down?", "Stop Bloating")
- **Native UI:** Heavy use of TikTok-native fonts and stickers to look organic to the feed

### Recommendations for Future Creatives

1. **Leverage "Glow Up":** Create more "Day 1 vs Day 30" transformation videos focusing on face shape (less puffy) and skin clarity
2. **Educational Hooks:** "Why your diet isn't working (it's water weight)" – targeting the weight loss audience with a specific "secret" (water retention)
3. **ASMR/Texture:** If the capsules have a distinct look or the bottle makes a satisfying sound, use ASMR elements for a "sensory" hook
4. **Urgency Messaging:** Continue leveraging deal/discount timing to drive immediate purchases
