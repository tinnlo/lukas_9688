## Script Strategy | 脚本策略

### Script 1: Drift Demo | 漂移演示
**File:** `RC_Drift_Car_Drift_Demo.md`
**Duration:** 35 seconds
**Hook Type:** Feature Declaration (Video 1 pattern)
**Angle:** Immediate visual proof of drift capability
**Key Beat:** Ground-level drift in first 3 seconds → Product intro → Feature proof with cones → Relatable confession ("I play with it more than my nephew") → Gift CTA

**Why This Works:**
- Qualifies audience immediately (names product + key specs)
- Uses included accessories (cones) to prove value
- Human element builds trust ("I play with it more")
- German VO for conversion

**Target Audience:** Gift givers + hobbyists seeking performance proof

---

### Script 2: Gift Dilemma | 礼物困境
**File:** `RC_Drift_Car_Gift_Dilemma.md`
**Duration:** 38 seconds
**Hook Type:** Secret/Gift (Video 3 pattern)
**Angle:** Relatable buyer's dilemma narrative
**Key Beat:** "I have a problem" → Sealed gift box confession → "I don't want to give it away" → Test drift → "Oh no, it's too cool" → Solution: buy two

**Why This Works:**
- The "authentic constraint" (shouldn't open it) creates intrigue
- Highly relatable scenario (gift-buyers secretly wanting it)
- No hard selling - product sells itself through narrative
- Natural CTA ("buying two" is logical solution)

**Target Audience:** Gift givers experiencing buyer's remorse

---

### Script 3: Night Racer | 夜间赛车
**File:** `RC_Drift_Car_Night_Racer.md`
**Duration:** 32 seconds
**Hook Type:** Visual Sign (Video 5 pattern)
**Angle:** LED lights as unique differentiator
**Key Beat:** Dark intro (LEDs only) → Drift with underglow → Day/night comparison → "Cool by day, crazy by night" → Specs + CTA

**Why This Works:**
- Instant visual intrigue (glowing lights in darkness)
- Beat-sync editing for viral potential
- Shows versatility (day + night use)
- Aesthetic appeal for younger audience (18-30)

**Target Audience:** Visual-driven buyers, younger demographics

## Production Notes | 制作说明

### Common Requirements Across All Scripts | 所有脚本的共同要求

**Equipment:** Smartphone camera, natural lighting (or dark room for Script 3)
**Surface:** Clean hardwood/tile floor for drift shots
**Accessories:** Use included traffic cones (proves value)
**Voiceover:** German primary (essential for conversion), Chinese translation provided
**Style:** Authentic UGC feel (Scripts 1-2), Aesthetic viral (Script 3)

### Critical Success Factors | 关键成功因素

1. **Show drift in first 3 seconds** - Static shots kill engagement
2. **German voiceover** - Massive conversion multiplier vs. silent videos
3. **Use included accessories** - Cones prove "complete package" value
4. **LED visibility** - Dim lighting for Script 3, slight dim for others
5. **One-take feel** - Even if edited, maintain natural flow
6. **Human beats** - Reactions, asides, relatability (not just product demo)
