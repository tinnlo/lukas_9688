## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY) | 建议

**DO (建议):**
1. **Show Texture Close-up:** Ensure lighting highlights the fleece material (fuzziness).
2. **Use Trending Audio:** Match the "vibe" of the jacket (e.g., Chill R&B for vintage).
3. **Include Sizing Info:** Add a text overlay like "I'm 180cm, wearing Size L".

**DON'T (避免):**
1. **Bad Lighting:** Dark video kills fashion sales.
2. **Cluttered Background:** Keep the background simple so the jacket pops.
3. **Over-editing:** Don't use crazy effects that hide the product details.

**OPPORTUNITY (机会):**
1. **ASMR Styling:** Record the sound of the zipper or the fabric rustling (Trend alert).
2. **"How to Style":** Show the jacket with 2 different pants (e.g., Jeans vs. Cargos).
3. **Reply to Comment:** Use a question "Is it warm?" as a text hook.
