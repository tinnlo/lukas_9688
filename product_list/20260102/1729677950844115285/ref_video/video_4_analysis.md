## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY)

**DO:**
1.  **Show the Texture:** Ensure the first shot clearly shows the "fleece" material quality, as that is the product's main visual appeal.
2.  **Use Screen Recording:** Actually show the price dropping in the cart (green text usually works well).
3.  **Localize Audio:** Ensure the German accent is native or high-quality AI; bad grammar kills trust in DE.

**DON'T:**
1.  **Don't hide the product:** Avoid talking for 3 seconds without showing the jacket.
2.  **Don't overcomplicate:** Do not add complex editing effects; keep it raw and direct.

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1.  **"Outfit Check" Angle:** Instead of just holding the jacket, start by wearing it to show fit, *then* go into the "buy now" pitch.
2.  **Reply to Comment:** Use a comment sticker asking "How much?" to start the video, making the answer feel requested.
