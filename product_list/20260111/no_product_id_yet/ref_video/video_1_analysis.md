## 12. Recommendations | 建议

*   **DO (值得模仿):**
    *   Start with the pain point (cold, hard work).
    *   Show the "Packability" (putting it in the trunk) – this is a huge differentiator.
    *   Use bold, high-contrast text overlays.
*   **DON'T (避免):**
    *   Don't film in a garage or fake snow setting if possible; real snow sells the utility.
    *   Don't make the intro too long; get to the "Solution" by second 5.
*   **OPPORTUNITIES (机会):**
    *   **ASMR Angle:** Focus on the "crunch" of the snow and the clean scrape sound.
    *   **Comparison:** Split screen with a "bad/small" shovel vs. this "big/efficient" one.
    *   **Emergency Angle:** "Don't get stuck in the snow without this in your trunk."
