## Key Selling Points (Image-Based)

1. **360° Rotation Mechanism** - Smooth swivel base eliminates twisting motion
2. **Stabilizing Flap** - 52cm flap tucks into seat gap, prevents slipping (critical differentiator vs. cheap discs)
3. **Anti-Slip Bottom** - High friction surface works on fabric and leather
4. **Universal Fit** - 40cm diameter fits most car seats, office chairs
5. **Discrete Design** - Black color doesn't clash with car interior aesthetics
6. **Multi-Use** - Car, office, home (increases perceived value)

## Creative Execution Notes

### Visual Requirements
- **Must Show:** The rotation in action (use white/yellow arrow graphics to visualize 360° movement)
- **Must Show:** Stabilizing flap installation (4-step sequence from product_image_3.webp)
- **Must Show:** Anti-slip bottom texture (close-up for trust)
- **Must Show:** Before/After comparison (struggling to exit vs. smooth rotation)

### Compliance Considerations
- **Health Claims:** ⚠️ Avoid saying "heilt" or "behandelt" - use "erleichtert" (makes easier) or "reduziert Belastung" (reduces strain)
- **Medical Language:** ⚠️ Do NOT mention "Therapie" or "Physiotherapie" - this is a comfort aid, not medical device
- **Safety:** ✅ "Anti-slip" and "secure grip" are acceptable claims (supported by product images)

### ElevenLabs v3 Cue Strategy
- **[warm]** for empathy-driven sections (addressing pain points)
- **[confident]** for solution introduction (building trust)
- **[matter-of-fact]** for technical explanations (mechanism, installation)
- **[understated]** for CTA (avoid overselling given 0 sales track record)

## Performance Prediction & Testing Strategy

**Expected Challenges:**
1. **Low Social Proof:** No testimonials or user-generated content available
2. **Niche Audience:** Elderly/mobility-impaired users are harder to reach on TikTok
3. **Visual Appeal:** Product is functional, not trendy (harder to go viral)

**Testing Recommendations:**
1. **Start with Script 1** (Senioren_Ausstiegshilfe) - Strongest emotional hook
2. **A/B test Hook Types:**
   - Pain-first (current approach)
   - vs. Demonstration-first (show rotation immediately)
3. **Target Hashtags:**
   - #Senioren #Mobilitätshilfe #Rückenschmerzen (direct audience)
   - #Autohack #Lifehack (broader reach)
4. **Avoid Generic Tags:** Skip #FYP #Viral (low relevance for assistive devices)

**Success Metrics:**
- **Engagement:** >3% (realistic for niche product)
- **Comments:** Look for "für meine Oma" (for my grandma) - indicates gift purchases
- **Shares:** Expect lower shares (not aspirational content)

**Pivot Plan if Fails:**
- Reframe as "office chair hack" (younger demographic)
- Emphasize comfort over mobility aid (less medical framing)
- Test on Facebook/Instagram where older demographics are more active
