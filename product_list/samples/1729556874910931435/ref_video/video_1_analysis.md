## 3. Hook/Opening Strategy (First 3 Seconds) | 开场策略(前3秒)

- **Hook Type | 钩子类型:** Feature-Led / Instant Gratification (功能导向/即时满足)

- **Visual + Audio Combination | 视觉+音频组合:** The visual likely shows the final step of placing the lamp on the bottle, perfectly synchronized with the audio confirming completion. This creates a "satisfaction" loop for the viewer.

## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY)

**DO:**
1. **Show variety:** Use different shapes/colors of bottles (gin, whiskey, wine) to show versatility.
2. **Demonstrate durability:** Briefly tap the lamp harder or shake the bottle to show it fits securely.
3. **Add text:** Include "Fits any bottle" or "3 Color Modes" as text overlays for silent viewers.

**DON'T:**
1. **Overcomplicate:** Do not show the unboxing or charging process unless it's a specific USP.
2. **Use poor lighting:** Ensure the room is dark enough for the lamp to shine, but not so dark the bottle is invisible.
3. **Talk too much:** Keep the VO minimal like this example; the visual does the work.

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1. **ASMR Angle:** Record the sound of the bottle being placed on the table and the "click" of the lamp turning on.
2. **Gift Angle:** Position it as a "Perfect Gift for Wine Lovers" in the text overlay.
3. **Restaurant POV:** Film it in a setting that looks like a home bar or romantic dinner to sell the "vibes."
