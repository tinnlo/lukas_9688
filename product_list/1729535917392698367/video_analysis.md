### Creative Mix Framework

The campaign represents a **balanced creative mix** targeting different psychological triggers:

## Recommendations for Future Creatives

### High Priority

1. **Hybrid Creative:** Combine the **Hook** from Video 2 (Value reveal) with the **Social Proof** style of Videos 3-5 for a "Hybrid" high-performing creative
   - Example: Carmen showing the 180-capsule bottle and calculating: "Das kostet mich nur 10 Cent pro Tag!"

2. **Stress-Relief Angle:** Based on magnesium's primary benefit, create more content connecting:
   - Work stress → Physical symptoms → Magnesium solution
   - Sleep problems → Magnesium before bed

3. **Before/After Series:** Have Carmen document a 30-day journey with specific metrics (sleep quality, energy levels)

### Medium Priority

4. **Comparison Content:** "My old magnesium vs. Sonnesee Komplex" showing the difference in formulation

5. **Educational Series:** "5 Signs You Need Magnesium" to create awareness before the pitch

6. **Seasonal Hooks:**
   - Winter: "Beat the winter blues with Magnesium"
   - New Year: "Start 2025 with better sleep and less stress"

### Testing Opportunities

- **Male creators:** Currently female-focused (Carmen), test male fitness/stress angle
- **Different age groups:** Test older demographics (50+) with fatigue messaging
- **Cultural segments:** Given "Made in Germany" positioning, test Turkish-German community (like debt counselor success in original incomplete analysis)
