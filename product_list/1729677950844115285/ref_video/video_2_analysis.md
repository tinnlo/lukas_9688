## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY)

**DO:**
1.  **Zoom in on Texture:** Ensure the "Thick lamb" fleece is shown in macro detail to prove quality.
2.  **Add Text Overlay:** Put "Winter Essential" or " -10°C Proof" on screen to capture silent scrollers.
3.  **Loop the Audio:** Make the end sentence flow back into the start for infinite loops.

**DON'T:**
1.  **Don't Over-explain:** The 8s format is perfect; don't drag it out to 30s with unnecessary specs.
2.  **Don't use Dark Lighting:** Winter clothes need to look clean and vibrant, not gloomy.

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1.  **ASMR Angle:** Record the sound of the zipper or the "rubbing" of the fleece to increase sensory engagement.
2.  **"Outfit Sandwich":** Show the jacket as the outer layer of a cool layered outfit to appeal more to the "Street Style" tag.
3.  **German Voiceover/Text:** Test a version with German text overlays ("Keine Angst vor Schnee") to potentially increase local conversion rate.
