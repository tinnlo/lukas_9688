## Content Strategy Notes

### Hook Patterns Used
1. **Problem Agitation:** "Deine Katze zerstoert dein Sofa?" - Direct pain point
2. **Curiosity Question:** "Wie viele Katzenspielzeuge hast du zuhause?" - Relatable setup
3. **POV Format:** "POV: Du stellst den neuen Kratzbaum auf" - Trending format

### Key Messaging Pillars
- **Quality:** Solid wood vs. cheap plastic alternatives
- **Functionality:** 4 toys in 1 compact unit
- **Aesthetics:** Fits modern home decor
- **Value:** Replaces multiple separate purchases

### Compliance Considerations
- Avoid absolute claims about stability for large cats (base is 19cm wide)
- "Echtholz" (real wood) claim should be verifiable
- No medical/behavioral guarantees about cat behavior
