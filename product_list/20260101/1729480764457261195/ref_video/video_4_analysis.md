## 12. Replication Insights | 复制建议

- **Production Budget:** Low/Medium (Smartphone + Good Lighting).
- **Equipment Needed:** Tripod, Natural Light (Window), Iron/Steamer (Crucial for "Hotel" look).

- **Reproducible Elements:** The script structure: [Style Hook] -> [Specific Design Name] -> [Emotional Benefit] -> [Adjectives] -> [CTA].

## 13. Recommendations | 建议 (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY)

**DO:**
1.  **Use "Before & After":** Show the "boring" bedroom before the red bedding is applied to maximize the "Hotel Feeling" impact.
2.  **Zoom on Texture:** When saying "Weich" (Soft), ensure a macro shot of the fabric is shown.
3.  **Add Price Anchor:** If the price is low (e.g., under €30), overlay text like "Luxus für unter 30€".

**DON'T:**
1.  **Use Wrinkled Bedding:** Nothing kills "Hotel Feeling" faster than wrinkles. Steam the sheets!
2.  **Over-clutter:** Keep the rest of the room minimal so the "Red Geo-design" pops.

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1.  **ASMR Angle:** Record the sound of the sheets rustling/snapping onto the bed for a sensory hook.
2.  **Seasonal Pivot:** If it's near holidays, frame the "Red" color as "Perfect for Christmas/Winter".
