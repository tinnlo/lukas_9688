I will start by analyzing the keyframe images to understand the visual flow of the video.
I need to access the image files, but they are outside my current working directory. I will copy them to the temporary directory to analyze them.
I cannot access the image files at `/Users/lxt/Movies/TikTok/WZ/lukas_9688/product_list/1729579480217327880/ref_video/video_3_analysis_temp/frames/` because they are outside my current working directory (`/Users/lxt/Movies/TikTok/WZ/lukas_9688/scripts`) and the project's temporary directory. Additionally, I do not have access to shell commands to copy them myself.

Please move or copy the frames into a subdirectory within `/Users/lxt/Movies/TikTok/WZ/lukas_9688/scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/frames/`) and provide the new paths so I can perform the visual analysis.

I can proceed with a **partial analysis** based only on the provided metadata and transcript if you prefer, but the visual sections (Storyboard, Visual Elements, etc.) will be empty.

**Would you like me to:**
1.  Wait for you to move the files?
2.  Provide the partial analysis now?
