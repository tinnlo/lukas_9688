## 13. Recommendations | 建议

**DO (建议做):**
1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Ensure the "15-degree tilt" is shown from the side profile to visually prove the benefit.
2.  **Sound Design:** Add ASMR eating sounds (crunching/purring) to increase satisfaction.
3.  **Split Screen:** Compare "Old Bowl" (cat struggling/vomiting) vs "New Bowl" (happy eating) for visual contrast.

**DON'T (建议不做):**
1.  **Don't Use Dark Lighting:** Pet products sell better in bright, clean, warm environments.
2.  **Don't Forget the "Mess":** If the bowl prevents mess, show a clean floor vs. a dirty floor.

**OPPORTUNITY (机会点):**
1.  **Ceramic vs. Plastic:** If the bowl is ceramic, emphasize "Hygiene/No Chin Acne" (Katzenakne), a huge topic in the German cat community.
2.  **Color Options:** Show multiple colors to appeal to aesthetic buyers.
