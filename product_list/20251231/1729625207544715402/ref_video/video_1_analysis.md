## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY)

**DO:**
1. **Show the Damage:** Start with a split second of a scratched-up sofa to trigger an emotional response before showing the solution.
2. **Add Text Overlay:** Ensure "Nie wieder kaputte Sofas" (No more broken sofas) is written on screen.
3. **Add a CTA:** End with "Jetzt bestellen" (Order now) or an arrow pointing to the basket.

**DON'T:**
1. **Don't use complex language:** Keep the German simple and benefit-oriented (as done here).
2. **Don't fake it:** If the cat doesn't like it, the audience will tell. Ensure the cat looks engaged.

**OPPORTUNITY:**
1. **ASMR Angle:** Record the actual scratching sound to emphasize the satisfying texture for cats.
2. **"Before/After":** Show a "Sad Cat" (bored/destructive) vs. "Happy Cat" (playing with toy).
