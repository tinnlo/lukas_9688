## 8. Risk & Compliance Notes | 风险与合规提醒

- **Religious Sensitivity:** Treat the artwork with high respect in all videos. Never place near bathrooms, floors, or shoes. This is crucial for Muslim audience.
- **Audio Copyright:** Ensure all nasheed/Islamic music tracks are royalty-free or from TikTok's approved library to avoid muting.
- **Material Accuracy:** Clearly specify if metal is steel, aluminum, or other. Don't overstate gold/silver coloring as actual precious metals (violates German consumer laws).
- **Shipping Transparency:** If shipping takes >7 days, be transparent or focus on "Pre-order for Ramadan" messaging.
- **Pricing:** Ensure mentioned price matches actual TikTok Shop listing to avoid consumer complaints.
