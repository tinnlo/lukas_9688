## 6. Production & Editing Notes | 制作与编辑备注

**Required Shots:**
- Extreme close-ups (macro) of dirty grout, burnt-on stove grease
- Steam nozzle blasting dirt (must capture thick white steam)
- Grease melting and liquifying under steam heat
- White cloth wiping cleaned surface (cloth turns dark from residue)
- Before/After comparisons (split screen or transition cuts)
- Wide shots showing cleaned rooms/surfaces

**Text Overlays:**
- Script 1: "Stoppt die Chemie!" / "Nur Wasser" / "100% sicher"
- Script 2: "Das isst du mit?" / "Echte Sauberkeit" / "Bakterienfrei"
- Script 3: "Putzen: Alt vs. Neu" / "Keine Schmerzen" / "5 Minuten"

**Audio:**
- Script 1: Calm, trust-building background music (warm tones)
- Script 2: Upbeat, satisfying music + heavy ASMR steam sound (aggressive "hiss")
- Script 3: Energetic, efficient music (fast tempo for quick cleaning montage)

**Sound Design Critical:**
- The steam "HISS" sound is a trust signal for power (must be prominent)
- Layer music at 30-50%, steam SFX at 80-100% during key demo moments

## 8. Risk & Compliance Notes | 风险与合规提醒

- **Medical Claims:** Do NOT say it "cures" anything. Stick to "removes bacteria" or "sterilizes" only if supported by manual
- **Safety Messaging:** Always show safe usage. Never point steam directly at skin or pets
- **Ad Disclosure:** Ensure "Werbung" or "Anzeige" label if required by TikTok rules for account type
- **Music Licensing:** Use only Commercial Sounds from TikTok library to avoid video muting

## 9. Success Metrics | 成功指标

- **Script 2 (Gross Reality):** High view duration + shares (satisfying transformations drive virality)
- **Script 3 (Lazy Cleaner):** High click-through to shop (practical value proposition = direct conversions)

**Recommended A/B Testing:**
- Test Script 2 (shock/satisfaction) vs Script 1 (trust/safety) to determine which audience segment converts better
