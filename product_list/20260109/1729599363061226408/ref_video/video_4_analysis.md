|:----------|:------|:----------|
| **Hook Strength** | 8/10 | Cleaning demos are naturally strong hooks. |

| **Trust Signals** | 8/10 | "Seeing is believing" mechanic works well here. |
| **Value Clarity** | 9/10 | Problem (Dirty) -> Solution (Steam) is very clear. |

## 13. Recommendations (DO/DON'T/OPPORTUNITY) | 建议

**DO | 建议做:**
1.  **Add Voiceover (German):** Explain *why* steam is better (e.g., "Kills 99.9% of bacteria"). Audio reinforces the visual.
    *   *建议添加德语旁白，解释为什么蒸汽更好（如“杀灭99.9%细菌”）。*
2.  **Show the "Gunk":** Wipe a white cloth after steaming to show the hidden dirt removed.
    *   *展示“脏污”：蒸汽后用白布擦拭，展示擦出的隐藏污垢。*
3.  **Specific Offer:** Add a "50% Off Today" text overlay at the end to boost conversion.
    *   *具体优惠：结尾添加“今日五折”字幕以提高转化率。*

**DON'T | 建议不做:**
1.  **Don't use weak steam visuals:** Ensure the device is fully heated so the steam is visible and powerful.
    *   *不要展示微弱的蒸汽：确保设备充分预热，使蒸汽可见且强劲。*
2.  **Don't ignore audio:** Even without VO, use sound effects (dings, whooshes) to emphasize the "clean".
    *   *不要忽视音频：即使没有旁白，也要使用音效（叮声、嗖声）强调“干净”。*

**OPPORTUNITY | 机会点:**
1.  **ASMR Angle:** Create a version with *only* natural cleaning sounds (amplified) - very popular on TikTok.
    *   *ASMR角度：制作一个仅包含自然清洁声音（放大）的版本——在TikTok上非常受欢迎。*
2.  **Pet Safety Focus:** Explicitly show a pet walking on the floor immediately after cleaning to prove safety (dry & chemical-free).
    *   *宠物安全重点：明确展示清洁后宠物立即在地板上行走，证明安全（快干且无化学残留）。*
