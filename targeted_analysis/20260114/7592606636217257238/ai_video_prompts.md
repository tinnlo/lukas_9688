## Shot 1: Hook | 开场钩子 (00:00-00:03)

```veo-prompt
Close-up shot, handheld camera movement (vlog-style, 24mm equivalent). Subject: South Asian male, 25-35 years old, short black hair, neatly groomed full beard and mustache, wearing black-rimmed glasses and a plain black crew-neck t-shirt. He is standing outdoors on a sidewalk with visible patches of black ice and frost. He looks directly into the lens with a concerned, warning expression, pointing downward toward the slippery ground. Lighting: Natural overcast winter daylight, cold color temperature. Background: Blurred residential street in winter. Duration: 3 seconds.

Audio: VO begins at 00:00 - "Black Ice is everywhere this month. Don't let your dad slip over." [Warning, urgent tone]
Music: Low-frequency rhythmic pulse starts.
```


## Shot 2: Problem/Reveal | 问题揭示 (00:03-00:06)

```veo-prompt
Medium shot, static camera, low angle. A pair of rugged "Video_Analysis_04" winter boots (black synthetic material, high-top design) are placed firmly on a thick patch of textured ice and light snow. The camera focuses on the boots' silhouette against the cold environment. Lighting: Bright, crisp winter light reflecting off the ice, creating high contrast. Background: Snow-covered ground with a shallow depth of field (f/4). Color palette: High-contrast blacks, whites, and icy blues. Duration: 3 seconds.

Audio: VO continues at 00:03 - "You need the right gear to stay upright."
Music: Beat drops into a steady, driving tempo.
```


## Shot 3: Solution/Demo | 解决方案演示 (00:06-00:09)

```veo-prompt
Extreme close-up (Macro), static camera. Male hands with South Asian skin tone are shown holding one "Video_Analysis_04" boot. The hands vigorously bend the front of the boot to demonstrate extreme material flexibility, then rotate the boot to reveal the underside: a deep-lugged, high-grip rubber sole with a complex anti-slip pattern. Lighting: Soft-box studio lighting mixed with natural light to highlight the texture of the rubber and the flexibility of the upper material. Background: Neutral blurred grey. Duration: 3 seconds.

Audio: VO at 00:06 - "Engineered for maximum flexibility and industrial-grade grip."
Music: Sound of rubber stretching/flexing (foley).
```


## Shot 4: Benefits | 优势效果 (00:09-00:12)

```veo-prompt
Close-up shot, top-down angle looking into the opening of the boot. A hand pulls back the tongue of the "Video_Analysis_04" boot to reveal a thick, plush, white faux-fur thermal lining. The camera moves slightly closer (push-in) to show the soft texture of the insulation. Lighting: Warm, inviting yellowish light directed into the boot to emphasize "warmth" and comfort, contrasting with the cool exterior. Background: Dark, out-of-focus wooden floor. Duration: 3 seconds.

Audio: VO at 00:09 - "Keep him warm and protected even in sub-zero temperatures."
Music: Music swells slightly, becoming more melodic.
```


## Shot 5: CTA | 行动号召 (00:12-00:14)

```veo-prompt
Medium shot, handheld camera. The South Asian male host from Shot 1 is now holding one of the boots in his hand, looking at the camera with a confident smile and a nod of approval. He gestures with his free hand toward the bottom left of the frame (where the shop link will appear). Lighting: Natural overcast light, consistent with Shot 1. Background: Same winter street setting as Shot 1. Duration: 2 seconds.

Audio: VO at 00:12 - "Click the link below to grab a pair before the next freeze!"
Music: Final rhythmic hit, then fades out.
```
