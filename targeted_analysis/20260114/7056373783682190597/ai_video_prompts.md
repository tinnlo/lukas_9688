## Shot 1: Hook | 开场钩子 (00:00-00:03)

```veo-prompt
Extreme close-up shot, macro lens details (100mm equivalent). Subject: The tip of a high-pressure washer nozzle (yellow or green tip) hovering inches above a grimy concrete patio surface. Action: The water jet blasts away a thick, black layer of algae and moss, revealing a pristine, bright concrete color underneath instantly. Lighting: Bright natural daylight, high contrast, water droplets sparkling in the sun. Texture focus: The rough texture of the dirty moss vs. the smooth clean stone. Camera: Handheld POV, slight vibration from the machine's power. Duration: 3 seconds.

Audio: Loud, satisfying white noise of high-pressure water. German voiceover begins: "Der befriedigendste Moment des Tages!" (The most satisfying moment of the day!)
```


## Shot 2: Problem Reveal | 问题揭示 (00:03-00:08)

```veo-prompt
Wide shot, slightly high angle (24mm equivalent). Visual: Shows the entire garden patio. A sharp, distinct line divides the frame diagonally: the bottom left is completely black with years of grime, the top right is freshly cleaned and bright. Action: The pressure washer wand enters the frame from the bottom right, spraying water to rinse loose debris across the boundary line. Lighting: Sunlight casting sharp shadows from garden plants on the edges. Background: Green lawn visible at the edges, contrasting with the grey/black stone. Camera: Slow backward dolly movement to reveal the scale of the dirty area. Duration: 5 seconds.

Audio: Pressure washer sound continues, slightly lower in mix. Voiceover: "Mach deinen Garten wieder sauber." (Make your garden clean again.)
```


## Shot 3: Solution Demo | 解决方案演示 (00:08-00:15)

```veo-prompt
Top-down view (Bird's eye), medium shot (50mm equivalent). Action: Systematically cleaning a square paver. The wand moves in a rhythmic, hypnotic side-to-side motion (left to right, drop down, right to left). The grime is peeled away in perfect strips like an eraser. Surface: Interlocking concrete pavers. Lighting: Even daylight, wet surface reflection. Camera: Static stabilization, locking onto the grid of the stones while the wand moves. Very satisfying geometry. Duration: 7 seconds.

Audio: Rhythmic "swish-swish" sound of the water spray synchronizing with the movement. Upbeat, minimal lo-fi background music fades in.
```


## Shot 4: Process & Satisfaction | 过程展示 (00:15-00:20)

```veo-prompt
Low angle, ground level shot (35mm equivalent). Perspective: Looking across the wet surface. Action: Water pushes a wave of muddy sludge off the edge of the patio into a drain or grass. The contrast between the murky water and the clean stone is emphasized. Subject: Rubber boots (yellow or black) visible in the background stepping on the clean section. Lighting: Backlit by the sun, making the water spray mist glow. Camera: Slow pan following the flow of the muddy water. Duration: 5 seconds.

Audio: Sound of water splashing and draining. Music swells slightly.
```


## Shot 5: Benefits & CTA | 优势与行动 (00:20-00:24)

```veo-prompt
Medium shot, transition to wide (28mm equivalent). Visual: The patio is now fully clean and drying in the sun. A hand (POV) gives a "thumbs up" into the frame or places a cleaning bottle (generic label) on a dry spot. Text Overlay (visualized): "Satisfying." Background: Vibrant green plants, bright clean stone, summer vibe. Lighting: Golden hour warmth, inviting and cozy. Camera: Static shot with subtle focus pull from the bottle/hand to the clean background. Duration: 4 seconds.

Audio: Final satisfying "ding" sound effect. Voiceover: "Reinigung. Befriedigend." (Cleaning. Satisfying.) Music fades out.
```
